# DatoCMS Responsive Images Setup

You are an expert at wiring DatoCMS responsive images into existing frontend
projects. This recipe creates or patches one shared Dato image wrapper,
normalizes `responsiveImage(...)` query shapes, and patches a real usage site
when the repo already exposes an image field.

See `../../../patterns/OUTPUT_STATUS.md` for output status definitions.

Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.

---

## Step 1: Detect Context (silent)

Silently examine the project:

1. **Framework** — detect Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, or Astro
2. **UI package** — inspect `package.json` for `react-datocms`,
   `vue-datocms`, `@datocms/svelte`, and `@datocms/astro`
3. **Existing Dato query utility** — inspect the shared query wrapper and Dato
   helper folder
4. **Existing image usage** — search for `responsiveImage`, `coverImage`,
   `heroImage`, `seoImage`, and current wrapper components
5. **File layout** — detect `src/` vs non-`src/`, plus any existing
   `lib/datocms`, `components/datocms`, or similar shared area
6. **Typed query context** — preserve gql.tada or GraphQL Code Generator usage
   if the repo already has it

### Stop conditions

- If the framework cannot be determined, ask the user which supported stack
  they are using.
- If the repo already has a materially different image abstraction, patch it in
  place by default instead of replacing it wholesale.

---

## Step 2: Ask Questions

Ask zero questions by default.

Only ask if the repo exposes multiple competing image abstractions and it is
unclear which one owns the rendered output.

---

## Step 3: Load References

Read only these references:

- `../../../references/shared/datocms-cda/client-and-config.md`
- `../../../references/shared/datocms-cda/images-and-videos.md`

Then load the matching framework references:

| Framework | Reference |
|---|---|
| Next.js / React | `../../../references/shared/datocms-frontend-integrations/react-image.md` |
| Nuxt / Vue | `../../../references/shared/datocms-frontend-integrations/vue-image.md` |
| SvelteKit | `../../../references/shared/datocms-frontend-integrations/svelte-image.md` |
| Astro | `../../../references/shared/datocms-frontend-integrations/astro-image.md` |

If the repo has no shared Dato query utility yet, also inspect the matching
framework guidance used by the CDA client baseline:

| Framework | Reference |
|---|---|
| Next.js | `../../../references/shared/datocms-frontend-integrations/nextjs.md` |
| Nuxt | `../../../references/shared/datocms-frontend-integrations/nuxt.md` |
| SvelteKit | `../../../references/shared/datocms-frontend-integrations/sveltekit.md` |
| Astro | `../../../references/shared/datocms-frontend-integrations/astro.md` |

---

## Step 4: Generate Code

Generate the smallest reusable responsive-image setup that fits the repo.

### Required project changes

1. **Install the framework package if missing**
   - React / Next.js -> `react-datocms`
   - Vue / Nuxt -> `vue-datocms`
   - SvelteKit -> `@datocms/svelte`
   - Astro -> `@datocms/astro`
2. **Create or patch the shared Dato query utility**
   - If one already exists, patch it in place
   - If none exists, create the same thin published-content CDA baseline used by
     the setup bundle's CDA client setup
3. **Create one shared Dato image wrapper**
   - Reuse the repo's existing Dato helper area
   - If none exists, place it under the Dato lib folder:
     - with `src/`: `src/lib/datocms/DatoImage.*`
     - without `src/`: `lib/datocms/DatoImage.*`
     - Nuxt may also use `components/datocms/DatoImage.vue` when that better
       matches the repo's structure
4. **Patch one obvious query or component usage**
   - Prefer an existing hero, cover, card, or SEO image field that is already
     rendered on the site
   - If no safe target exists, create only the shared wrapper and report
     `scaffolded`

### Wrapper defaults

- **React / Next.js:** default to `<SRCImage />`; support an opt-in path to
  `<Image />` only for transparency, crossfade, or custom intersection tuning
- **Vue / Nuxt:** default to `<NakedImage>`; support an opt-in path to
  `<Image>`
- **SvelteKit:** default to `<NakedImage />`; support an opt-in path to
  `<Image />`
- **Astro:** wrap the native `@datocms/astro/Image` component only

### Required query shape

Patch real image fields toward this shape:

```graphql
responsiveImage(imgixParams: { auto: format }) {
  src
  width
  height
  alt
  title
  base64
}
```

Add `sizes` only when the rendered component needs it. Prefer omitting `srcSet`
unless the project clearly needs explicit CDN-generated variants.

### Mandatory rules

- Always use `responsiveImage(imgixParams: { auto: format })`
- Never request both `base64` and `bgColor`
- Prefer omitting `srcSet` unless the repo clearly needs it
- Preserve framework-specific prop casing:
  - React -> `pictureClassName`, `imgClassName`
  - Vue -> `picture-class`, `img-class`, `src-set-candidates`
  - Svelte / Astro -> `pictureClass`, `imgClass`, `srcSetCandidates`
- Astro imports must use `@datocms/astro/Image`, never `@datocms/astro`
- Patch existing query ownership in place instead of adding a parallel query
  path

### Output status

- Report `scaffolded` if only the wrapper was created, if no real image field
  was patched, or if the query shape still contains placeholders
- Report `production-ready` only when a concrete Dato image field renders
  through the shared wrapper with no unresolved responsive-image TODOs

---

## Step 5: Next Steps

After generating the files, tell the user:

1. Which image field was patched, if any
2. Which wrapper component was created and where
3. Whether the repo is still `scaffolded` because a real field integration was
   not safe to patch automatically
4. Whether a thin shared CDA query utility had to be created as part of the
   setup

---

## Verification Checklist

Before presenting the result, verify:

1. The framework-appropriate Dato image package is installed or added
2. The repo has a shared Dato query utility after the change
3. The shared image wrapper matches the framework defaults
4. The patched query uses `responsiveImage(imgixParams: { auto: format })`
5. The query does not request both `base64` and `bgColor`
6. Astro uses only `@datocms/astro/Image` subpath imports
7. The result is `scaffolded` if no real image field could be integrated
