  Interact with the DatoCMS Content Management API (CMA) using
  @datocms/cma-client, @datocms/cma-client-node, or @datocms/cma-client-browser.
  Use when users need programmatic CMA scripts: create/update/delete/publish
  records, bulk import/export (including CSV pipelines), paginate through large
  record sets, upload assets from URL/local files and set metadata, update
  structured text or block payloads, create/modify schema (models/fields/blocks),
  fork/promote environments, configure webhooks and build triggers, manage roles
  and API tokens, schedule publish/unpublish workflows, consume generated CMA
  schema types for type-safe record operations, manage dashboard and schema menus,
  install and configure plugins, update project settings and maintenance mode,
  create saved filters, query audit logs and usage analytics, manage upload
  tracks and tags, and check subscription limits.

# DatoCMS Content Management API Skill

You are an expert at writing code that interacts with the DatoCMS Content Management API (CMA). Use this workflow as a default. Reorder or skip steps when the task is purely diagnostic, advisory, or the user only needs an explanation.

---

## Step 1: Detect Context

If the project context is already established in this conversation (client
package, token variable, environment targeting), skip broad detection below.
Re-inspect only when a question cannot be answered from prior context.

Silently examine the project to determine the runtime and which CMA client package is available.

1. Read `package.json` and check for these packages (in priority order):
   - `@datocms/cma-client` — Universal/isomorphic package. **Recommended for most cases.** Works in any environment with native `fetch`. Only provide a `fetchFn` if your runtime lacks native Fetch API.
   - `@datocms/cma-client-node` — Node.js-optimized. Adds upload helpers (`createFromLocalFile`, `createFromUrl`). Use when you need file-system upload convenience methods.
   - `@datocms/cma-client-browser` — Browser-optimized. Adds `createFromFileOrBlob()` for File/Blob uploads.

2. If none is installed, recommend the appropriate package:
   - General / universal → `@datocms/cma-client`
   - Node.js project needing upload helpers → `@datocms/cma-client-node`
   - Browser-only project needing File/Blob uploads → `@datocms/cma-client-browser`

3. Search for existing `buildClient()` calls to understand how the project already configures the client (API token source, environment targeting, etc.).

4. Check for a `.env` or `.env.local` file to see if `DATOCMS_API_TOKEN` (or a similar variable) is already defined.

5. Check for `@datocms/cli` in `devDependencies` and an existing `cma-types.ts` file to determine if CMA type generation is already set up. Do **not** proactively suggest setting up type generation.

**Important:** The CMA requires an API token with `can_access_cma: true` and a role granting the needed permissions (not a read-only CDA token). If you see a token variable named like `DATOCMS_READONLY_API_TOKEN` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_DATOCMS_API_TOKEN`, warn the user that CMA operations need a token with CMA access enabled. The token does not need to be "full-access" — it can be scoped to specific models, actions, and environments via its role.

## Step 2: Understand the Task

Classify the user's task into one or more categories. Ask follow-up questions only when the request is ambiguous or the risk of a wrong assumption is high.

- **Content operations** — Create, read, update, delete, publish, or unpublish records
- **Upload operations** — Upload files, manage assets, update metadata, bulk tag
- **Schema operations** — Create or modify models, fields, fieldsets, block models
- **Filtering & querying** — Search records, filter by fields, paginate large collections
- **Localization** — Work with localized field values and multi-locale content
- **Blocks & modular content** — Modular content fields, single-block fields, nested block payloads
- **Structured text & block tooling** — DAST payloads, embedded blocks, block traversal, debugging helpers
- **Environment operations** — Fork, promote, rename, delete sandbox environments
- **Webhook & deploy operations** — Configure webhooks, build triggers, deploy management
- **Access control** — Create roles, manage API tokens, invite users
- **Scheduling** — Schedule publish/unpublish, manage workflows
- **Migration & scripting** — Bulk data operations, content seeding, field migrations
- **Type generation** — Consume generated CMA schema types or wire typed record operations
- **Dashboard & schema menu management** — Organize navigation sidebar items, group models in menus
- **Plugin management** — Install, configure, or audit plugins programmatically
- **Project settings & usage** — Site settings, maintenance mode, subscription limits, usage tracking, white-label
- **Saved filters** — Create or manage saved record/upload filter views
- **Audit & debugging** — Query audit logs, inspect async job results, CMA-side search

If the user's request is clear and falls into an obvious category, skip the clarifying questions and proceed directly.

## Step 3: Load References

Based on the task classification, read the appropriate reference files from the `references/` directory next to this skill file. Prefer section-level reads inside long references by using each file's Quick Navigation section first. Only load what is relevant.

**Always load:**
- `references/client-setup-and-errors.md` — Package choice, client setup, token/environment config, error handling

**Load per category:**

- `Content operations` → `references/records.md`
- `Upload operations` → `references/uploads.md`
- `Schema operations` → `references/schema.md`
- `Filtering & querying` → `references/filtering-and-pagination.md`
- `Localization` → `references/localization.md`
- `Blocks & modular content` → `references/block-records-and-modular-content.md`
- `Structured text & block tooling` → `references/structured-text-and-block-tools.md`
- `Environment operations` → `references/environments.md`
- `Webhook & deploy operations` → `references/webhooks-and-triggers.md`
- `Access control` → `references/access-control.md`
- `Scheduling` → `references/scheduling.md`
- `Migration & scripting` → `references/migration-patterns.md`
- `Type generation` → `references/type-generation.md`
- `Dashboard & schema menu management` → `references/dashboard-and-schema-menus.md`
- `Plugin management` → `references/plugins.md`
- `Project settings & usage` → `references/project-settings-and-usage.md`
- `Saved filters` → `references/saved-filters.md`
- `Audit & debugging` → `references/async-jobs-and-search.md`

**Load cross-cutting references when needed:**
- If the task involves localized fields in any context → also load `references/localization.md`
- If the task uses `raw*()` methods, generated CMA types, advanced client behavior, or platform limits → also load `references/client-types-and-behaviors.md`
- If the task involves modular content or single-block fields → also load `references/block-records-and-modular-content.md`
- If the task involves DAST structured text, `SchemaRepository`, `inspectItem()`, or block traversal utilities → also load `references/structured-text-and-block-tools.md`
- If the task involves listing many records → also load `references/filtering-and-pagination.md`
- If the task is a migration script → also load `references/migration-patterns.md` plus whatever domain refs are needed
- If the task involves video upload subtitles/tracks or upload tag management → also load `references/upload-tracks-and-tags.md`
- If the task involves maintenance mode before a migration → also load `references/project-settings-and-usage.md`
- If the task involves checking subscription limits before bulk operations → also load `references/project-settings-and-usage.md`

## Step 4: Generate the Solution

When the response includes code, follow these default rules:

### Client Setup
- Default to `buildClient()` from the detected package (Step 1)
- Store the API token in an environment variable, never hardcode it
- Set the `environment` option when working with sandbox environments

### API Surface
- Default to the simplified API (e.g., `client.items.create()`) because it handles serialization/deserialization automatically
- Switch to `raw*()` methods only when the task explicitly needs raw JSON:API payloads, relationship metadata, or generated CMA schema types are intentionally part of the solution

### Pagination
- Prefer `*.listPagedIterator()` (for example `client.items.listPagedIterator()`) when iterating over collections
- Avoid manual offset/limit pagination loops unless a resource genuinely lacks an iterator
- Use `for await...of` to consume async iterators

### Blocks
- Prefer `buildBlockRecord()` when creating block records for the simplified API
- Import it from the same package as `buildClient`

### Error Handling
- Catch `ApiError` for API failures — it provides `.errors` getter and `.findError()` method
- Catch `TimeoutError` for request timeouts in long-running or request-heavy flows
- Import both from the same package as `buildClient`

### TypeScript
- Follow the TypeScript strictness rules: no `as unknown as`, no unnecessary `as` casts
- Let TypeScript infer types wherever possible
- Use `import type { ... }` for type-only imports

---

## Step 5: Verify

Before presenting the final code:

1. **Token permissions** — CMA operations need a token with CMA access enabled and appropriate role permissions (not a CDA-only read-only token). Schema changes require a role with `can_edit_schema: true`.
2. **Environment targeting** — If working with a sandbox, ensure the `environment` config option is set
3. **Error handling** — Ensure `ApiError` is caught at appropriate boundaries
4. **Pagination** — If the solution iterates a collection that could exceed a single page, prefer `listPagedIterator()`
5. **Type safety** — Ensure no type assertions (`as`) are used to silence errors
6. **Imports** — Ensure all imports come from the correct package (the one detected in Step 1)
7. **Generated types** — If the solution intentionally uses generated CMA types (`cma-types.ts`), ensure the chosen path is typed end to end: simplified API generics by default, or `raw*()` / `RawApiTypes.Item<>` only when raw payload access is intentional

If the generated code is a script (migration, seeding, etc.), wrap it in an async function with proper error handling and progress reporting.

## Cross-Skill Routing

This skill covers **content management via the REST CMA** (mutations, schema, uploads, webhooks, scripts). If the task involves any of the following, activate the companion skill:

| Condition | Route to |
|---|---|
| CLI commands, migration scaffolding, `datocms schema:generate`, or environment operations via `npx datocms` | **datocms-cli** |
| Querying content with GraphQL for frontend display | **datocms-cda** |
| Setting up draft mode, Web Previews, Content Link, real-time subscriptions, or framework integration | **datocms-frontend-integrations** |
| Building a DatoCMS plugin | **datocms-plugin-builder** |
