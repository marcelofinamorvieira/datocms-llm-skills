# DatoCMS Robots and Sitemaps Setup

You are an expert at generating `robots.txt` and sitemap outputs for DatoCMS
frontends. This skill focuses on crawler-safe route generation, same-domain URL
output, and deterministic public-route mapping.

**Shared bundle requirement:** This skill reuses references from `datocms-cda`
and `datocms-frontend-integrations`. Ensure those companion skills are installed
alongside this one so the referenced files are available.

**Output states:**

- `scaffolded` — route files exist, but the public site URL or model-to-route
  mappings still contain placeholders or unresolved sections
- `production-ready` — robots and sitemap outputs are wired to real URLs, use
  explicit public-route mappings, and have no unresolved TODOs

Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.

---

## Step 1: Detect Context (silent)

Silently examine the project:

1. **Framework** — detect Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, or Astro
2. **Public site URL config** — inspect env files for a framework-appropriate
   site URL
3. **Existing SEO helper** — check whether a shared `public-url` helper already
   exists from SEO setup
4. **Existing preview routing** — inspect any `recordToWebsiteRoute`,
   route-builder helpers, or other public URL mapping utilities
5. **Existing robots/sitemap routes** — search for framework-native route files
6. **Public content sections** — inspect routes and page directories for public
   sections such as `/blog`, `/docs`, or `/help`
7. **Search index suffix hints** — inspect existing Site Search env vars or
   Dato-related docs in the repo for section-specific crawler suffixes

### Stop conditions

- If the framework cannot be determined, ask the user.
- If the repo already has a materially different sitemap implementation, patch
  it in place by default instead of rewriting it wholesale.

---

## Step 2: Ask Questions

Ask zero questions by default.

Only ask if the repo exposes multiple public sections but their sitemap or
crawler boundaries cannot be inferred safely from the existing route structure.

---

## Step 3: Load References

Read only these references:

- `../../../skills/datocms-frontend-integrations/references/robots-and-sitemaps.md`

If the repo already has SEO or preview-route helpers, inspect those files
directly and reuse them instead of loading more references than necessary.

---

## Step 4: Generate Code

Generate framework-native crawler outputs and one shared mapping layer.

### Required project changes

1. **Reuse or create the shared public URL helper**
   - If SEO setup already created `public-url.ts`, reuse it
   - Otherwise create the same helper shape here
2. **Create one shared sitemap mapping layer** that defines:
   - explicit public sections
   - path builders
   - `lastmod` sources
3. **Generate framework-native `robots.txt` output**
4. **Generate framework-native sitemap output**
5. **Generate a sitemap index only when more than one sitemap document is
   actually emitted**

### Shared mapping rules

Every discovered public model or section must have:

- one explicit URL builder
- one explicit source of `lastmod`

If either is missing, keep the result `scaffolded`.

### Public site URL env convention

Use the same env var as SEO setup:

- Next.js: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
- Nuxt: `NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
- SvelteKit: `PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
- Astro: `PUBLIC_SITE_URL`

### Mandatory crawler rules

- `Allow` directives for Dato crawler sections must appear before
  `Disallow: /`
- Emit a `DatoCmsSearchBot` group even when the site has only one search index
- Emit suffix-specific groups such as `DatoCmsSearchBotDocs` only when the repo
  already has multiple indexes or clearly separated sections
- Add `Sitemap:` directives that point to the generated sitemap entrypoint
- Only emit absolute URLs under the configured public site URL
- Keep robots and sitemap generation deterministic and free of guessed routes

### Framework-native routes

Use the framework's own route shape:

- Next.js -> metadata route helpers for robots/sitemap where possible
- Nuxt -> `server/routes`
- SvelteKit -> `+server.ts`
- Astro -> page endpoints

Reuse existing file-placement conventions in the repo.

### Output status

- Report `scaffolded` if the site URL is still a placeholder or any public
  section lacks a concrete route / `lastmod` mapping
- Report `production-ready` only when the generated outputs have real URLs,
  deterministic mappings, and no unresolved crawler TODOs

---

## Step 5: Next Steps

After generating the files, tell the user:

1. Which sitemap entrypoint was created
2. Which public sections were added to the sitemap source list
3. Whether suffix-specific Dato crawler groups were generated
4. Which mappings still need real route or `lastmod` logic, if any

---

## Verification Checklist

Before presenting the result, verify:

1. `robots.txt` contains ordered `Allow` directives before any catch-all
   `Disallow: /`
2. The generated sitemap contains only same-domain absolute URLs
3. A sitemap index is generated only when multiple sitemap documents exist
4. Every public section has an explicit route builder and `lastmod` source
5. The framework-native route mechanism matches the detected stack
6. The result is `scaffolded` if the site URL or route mappings remain
   unresolved
