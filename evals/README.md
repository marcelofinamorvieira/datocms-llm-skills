# Skill Trigger Eval Loop (Test, Measure, Refine)

This repo now includes a model-agnostic loop for improving skill trigger quality.

It follows the same pattern described in Anthropic's skill-iteration article:
1. Test with curated trigger/non-trigger prompts.
2. Measure with stable metrics (recall, precision, F1, false negatives/positives).
3. Refine skill descriptions, then re-test and compare.

## Two Eval Tracks

This repo now keeps two distinct model eval tracks:

- **Claude Code eval track**: uses the existing Claude-style run outputs in `evals/results/*.json`.
- **Codex eval track**: uses `evals/scripts/run_codex_trigger_eval.py` plus the analyzer/comparison scripts.

Published snapshots and side-by-side metrics live in `evals/reports/README.md`.

## What Is In This Folder

- `*.json`: trigger test cases (`query`, `should_trigger`).
- Fixtures may also declare `query_mode` (`implicit`, `explicit`, `overlap`) and `boundary_with` for overlap cases.
- Canonical fixture naming is `evals/<skill-name>-skill-eval.json` for every shipped skill.
- `results/*.json`: raw run outputs (JSON or text preamble + JSON).
- `results/manifest.json`: declares which checked-in result files are intentionally published and which skills are explicitly excluded.
- `scripts/analyze_trigger_results.py`: computes metrics from raw outputs.
- `scripts/generate_refinement_briefs.py`: writes per-skill refinement briefs from misses.
- `scripts/compare_trigger_runs.py`: compares baseline vs candidate runs.
- `scripts/run_codex_trigger_eval.py`: runs Codex-trigger classification directly from skill frontmatter descriptions.
- `scripts/validate_skill_repo.py`: validates repo invariants that the skill docs depend on, including metadata sync checks.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Codex eval track:

- the `codex` CLI must be installed
- the CLI must already be authenticated
- the `codex` binary must be available on `PATH`

You can verify the local docs, metadata, and routing invariants at any time with:

```bash
python3 evals/scripts/validate_skill_repo.py --repo-root .
```

That validator now also checks that every shipped skill has a canonically named eval
fixture and that the checked-in baseline result filenames match canonical skill names.

Before publishing, run the same validator with the clean-tree gate enabled:

```bash
python3 evals/scripts/validate_skill_repo.py --repo-root . --require-clean-git
```

## Workflow

### 1) Test

Run one of these two tracks:

Claude Code track:
- Produce or update `evals/results/*-eval-results.json` with your Claude run process.
- Keep the output contract below so analyzer scripts can read it.

Codex track:
- Run:

```bash
python3 evals/scripts/run_codex_trigger_eval.py \
  --repo-root . \
  --output-dir evals/runs/2026-03-06-candidate/raw
```

The runner auto-discovers every public `SKILL.md` in `skills/` and expects a
matching `evals/<skill-name>-skill-eval.json` fixture for each one.

Fixture metadata guidelines:
- Use `query_mode: implicit` for natural-language routing cases.
- Use `query_mode: explicit` when the user directly names the target skill.
- Use `query_mode: overlap` plus `boundary_with` when a prompt intentionally sits on a skill boundary.

Important output contract for each query result:
- `query`
- `should_trigger`
- `query_mode`
- `boundary_with`
- `trigger_rate`
- `triggers`
- `runs`
- `pass`

You can keep human-readable preambles before JSON; the analyzer handles both pure JSON and mixed-output files.

Recommended run layout:

```text
evals/runs/
  2026-03-05-baseline/
    raw/*.json
  2026-03-06-candidate/
    raw/*.json
```

The Codex runner now performs a preflight check and fails fast with a clear error if `codex exec` is unavailable.

### 2) Measure

Analyze a run directory:

```bash
python3 evals/scripts/analyze_trigger_results.py \
  --results-dir evals/runs/2026-03-06-candidate/raw \
  --output-json evals/runs/2026-03-06-candidate/analysis.json \
  --output-markdown evals/runs/2026-03-06-candidate/analysis.md
```

Analyze current repo baseline files:

```bash
python3 evals/scripts/analyze_trigger_results.py \
  --results-dir evals/results \
  --output-json evals/results/latest-analysis.json \
  --output-markdown evals/results/latest-analysis.md
```

When `evals/results/manifest.json` is present, the analysis report includes the
published result coverage and any explicit exclusions.

### 3) Refine

Generate skill-specific briefs with concrete misses and suggested trigger boundary changes:

```bash
python3 evals/scripts/generate_refinement_briefs.py \
  --analysis evals/runs/2026-03-06-candidate/analysis.json \
  --skills-root . \
  --output-dir evals/runs/2026-03-06-candidate/refinement-briefs
```

Refinement rule of thumb:
- Edit frontmatter `description` first (small deltas).
- Re-run evals before touching the body of `SKILL.md`.

### 4) Compare

Compare candidate vs baseline:

```bash
python3 evals/scripts/compare_trigger_runs.py \
  --baseline evals/runs/2026-03-05-baseline/analysis.json \
  --candidate evals/runs/2026-03-06-candidate/analysis.json \
  --output-markdown evals/runs/2026-03-06-candidate/comparison.md \
  --output-json evals/runs/2026-03-06-candidate/comparison.json
```

Keep changes only when they improve recall and keep precision within acceptable regression limits for your project.

## Notes

- Default classification threshold is `0.5` (`trigger_rate >= 0.5` means predicted trigger).
- Use `--threshold` on `analyze_trigger_results.py` if your policy differs.
- `compare_trigger_runs.py` expects both inputs to come from `analyze_trigger_results.py` output JSON.
